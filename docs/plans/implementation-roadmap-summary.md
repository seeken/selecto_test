- **UI Complexity**: Phase 3 SelectoComponents features should be developed with comprehensive user testing

### Resource Allocation Recommendations
- **Core Team**: Focus on Phases 1-2 (Selecto engine enhancements)
- **UI Team**: Can begin Phase 3 planning while Phase 2 is in development  
- **QA Team**: Heavy involvement in Phases 1-2 for compatibility and performance testing

### Success Metrics by Phase
**Phase 1**: 
- 100% backward compatibility
- <10% performance impact
- Developer adoption of new syntax >50%

**Phase 2**:
- Query performance competitive with hand-written SQL
- Subfilter adoption for complex scenarios >80%
- Analytics dashboard usage >60%

**Phase 3**:
- User task completion time reduced by 40%
- Self-service analytics adoption >70%
- Mobile usability scores >85%

### Optional Features (Can be Deferred)
- Advanced SQL Features (Phase 4.1) - Only if specific use cases emerge
- Temporal & Time-Series (Phase 4.3) - Unless time-series is a primary use case
- Dashboard Panels (Phase 6.1) - Complex feature that can wait for user demand

## Conclusion

This roadmap prioritizes foundational improvements first, followed by high-impact query capabilities, then user experience enhancements. The 12-month timeline is aggressive but achievable with proper resource allocation. The modular nature of the plans allows for parallel development in later phases and provides flexibility to adjust based on user feedback and changing priorities.

**Recommended Start Order:**
1. Parameterized Joins & Dot Notation (critical foundation)
2. Output Format Enhancement (enables UI improvements)  
3. Subfilter System (high business value)
4. Window Functions & Analytics (major capability expansion)

Each phase delivers concrete value while building toward the comprehensive Selecto ecosystem vision.
