       192    
       193 -  The Selecto ecosystem demonstrates strong architectural 
     foundations with comprehensive functionality and excellent test
     coverage. The recommended improvements focus on API consistency,
     module organization, and completion of advanced features while
     maintaining the system's current strengths. The phased approach
     ensures minimal disruption to existing users while enabling
     significant improvements in maintainability and developer
     experience.

       195 -  Key priorities are resolving critical technical debt, 
           - standardizing APIs, and completing the advanced feature 
     set
           -  that the test infrastructure already supports. This will 
           - position Selecto as a mature, production-ready query 
           - building solution for the Elixir ecosystem.

           + unified error handling now implemented, the ecosystem is 
           + ready for **Phase 2 (Module Organization)** to improve 
     code
           +  maintainability and separation of concerns.
       197 +  
       198 +  **Next Priority**: Tackle the remaining custom column 
           + selection bug and begin module reorganization to separate 
           + SelectoComponents concerns (state management, routing, UI 
           + rendering) for better maintainability and testing.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Check if film rating aggregation filter bug is already fixed    
     ☒ Update SELECTO_IMPROVEMENT_RECOMMENDATIONS.md with current 
       status

● Updated the SELECTO_IMPROVEMENT_RECOMMENDATIONS.md document to
  reflect current status:

  ✅ Completed Phase 1 - API Consistency improvements are now marked as
   completed
  ✅ Filter aggregation bug resolved - Tests confirm film rating
  filters are working correctly✅ Hardcoded debug logging removed -
  Clean execution patterns implemented

  Next phase is Module Organization, focusing on:
  - Resolving the remaining custom column selection bug
  - Separating SelectoComponents concerns (state, routing, UI)
  - Extracting execution modules from core Selecto

  The document now accurately reflects the completed work and
  identifies Phase 2 as the next priority.

> Lets get on to Module Organization!
