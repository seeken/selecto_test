  ⎿  ☒ Research current query patterns and performance bottlenecks
     ☐ Design query optimization framework architecture
     ☐ Implement query analysis and optimization hints
     ☐ Add query plan caching and reuse mechanisms
     ☐ Create performance monitoring and metrics
     ☐ Test optimization framework with real queries

● Based on my research, here's what a Query Optimization Framework for Selecto would look like:

  Architecture Overview

  The framework would add several layers between query building and execution:

  1. Query Analysis Engine

  defmodule Selecto.QueryAnalyzer do
    @moduledoc """
    Analyzes generated SQL queries to identify optimization opportunities
    """

    defstruct [
      :query_complexity,    # Simple, Medium, Complex
      :join_patterns,       # [:hierarchical, :many_to_many, :star_schema]
      :optimization_hints,  # Suggested optimizations
      :estimated_cost,      # Query cost estimation
      :bottlenecks         # Identified performance issues
    ]
  end

  2. Query Plan Cache

  defmodule Selecto.QueryPlanCache do
    @moduledoc """
    Caches optimized query plans and execution strategies
    """

    # Cache key: domain + selectors + filters + joins
    # Cache value: optimized query + execution plan + performance metrics
  end

  3. Optimization Rules Engine

  defmodule Selecto.QueryOptimizer do
    @moduledoc """
    Applies optimization rules to improve query performance
    """

    # Optimization strategies:
    # - Index usage hints
    # - Join reordering  
    # - Subquery -> CTE conversion
    # - Filter pushdown
    # - Selective field loading
  end

  4. Performance Monitor

  defmodule Selecto.PerformanceMonitor do
    @moduledoc """
    Tracks query performance and provides recommendations
    """

    # Metrics:
    # - Query execution time
    # - Row counts processed
    # - Index hit ratios
    # - Join efficiency
    # - Cache hit rates
  end

  Key Features

  Query Analysis

  - Complexity scoring - Rates queries by join count, filter complexity, aggregations
  - Pattern detection - Identifies common patterns (hierarchical, OLAP, tagging)
  - Bottleneck identification - Finds slow joins, missing indexes, inefficient filters

  Optimization Hints

  - Index recommendations - Suggests indexes for frequent filter patterns
  - Join reordering - Optimizes join order based on selectivity
  - Filter pushdown - Moves filters closer to data sources
  - Materialized CTEs - Converts expensive subqueries to CTEs

  Caching Strategies

  - Query plan caching - Stores optimized execution plans
  - Result caching - Caches frequent aggregate queries
  - Schema-aware invalidation - Smart cache invalidation on data changes

  Performance Monitoring

  - Real-time metrics - Track execution times, row counts, resource usage
  - Trend analysis - Identify performance degradation over time
  - Alerting - Notify on slow queries or resource spikes

  Implementation Approach

  Phase 1: Query Analysis

  - Add Selecto.QueryAnalyzer to analyze generated SQL
  - Implement complexity scoring and pattern detection
  - Add optimization hints to query metadata

  Phase 2: Basic Optimization

  - Implement join reordering based on selectivity estimates
  - Add filter pushdown for better performance
  - Create index usage hints

  Phase 3: Caching Layer

  - Build query plan cache with smart invalidation
  - Add result caching for expensive aggregations
  - Implement cache warming strategies

  Phase 4: Monitoring & Metrics

  - Add performance tracking to Selecto.Executor
  - Build metrics dashboard for query performance
  - Implement alerting for performance regressions

  This framework would integrate seamlessly with the existing Selecto architecture while providing significant performance improvements through intelligent query optimization and caching.
