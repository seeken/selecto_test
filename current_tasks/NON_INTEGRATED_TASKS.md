    - Integration needed: Connect to shareable links feature
    - Impact: Cleaner URLs for sharing

## Integration Recommendations

### Quick Wins (1-2 hours each)
- Virtual Scrolling (COMPTASK-0010) - Just needs initialization call
- Query Performance Metrics (COMPTASK-0005) - Add to debug panel
- Shareable View Links (COMPTASK-0023) - Add share button

### Medium Effort (4-8 hours each)
- Modal Detail View (COMPTASK-0014) - Row click handlers and modal state
- Saved Filter Sets (COMPTASK-0013) - UI for save/load operations
- Bulk Actions (COMPTASK-0017) - Selection state management

### Significant Effort (1-2 days each)
- Inline Editing (COMPTASK-0015) - Complex state management
- Subselect UI (COMPTASK-0024) - Complex UI interactions
- CTE Visualization (COMPTASK-0025) - Graph rendering

## Next Steps

1. Prioritize based on user needs
2. Start with quick wins for immediate value
3. Consider creating integration tasks for each component
4. Test thoroughly as features are integrated
5. Update documentation as features go live

## Notes
- All components are already built and tested individually
- Integration mainly involves wiring up the UI and state management
- Some features may need minor adjustments to work together
- Consider feature flags for gradual rollout
