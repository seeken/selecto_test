# COMPTASK-0005: Error Recovery Mechanisms

## Status: Not Started
## Priority: CRITICAL
## Effort: 1 day
## Phase: 1.1
## Week: 1

## Description
Implement retry mechanisms and recovery strategies for transient errors, allowing users to recover from temporary failures.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Identify retryable error types
- [ ] Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Add retry button to error display
- [ ] Preserve form state during retries
- [ ] Limit retry attempts
- [ ] Show retry status to user
- [ ] Provide alternative actions when retry fails

## Technical Requirements
- Error type detection for retryable errors
- Exponential backoff implementation
- State preservation during retries
- Retry counter and limits

## Files to Create/Modify
- `vendor/selecto_components/lib/selecto_components/error_handling/error_recovery.ex` (new)
- `vendor/selecto_components/lib/selecto_components/error_handling/error_display.ex` (modify)
- `vendor/selecto_components/lib/selecto_components/form.ex` (modify)

## Dependencies
- COMPTASK-0001 (Error display foundation)

## Testing Requirements
- Test retry logic
- Test exponential backoff
- Test retry limits
- Test state preservation
- Test with various error types

## Notes
- Only retry truly transient errors
- Consider user experience during retries
- Avoid infinite retry loops
