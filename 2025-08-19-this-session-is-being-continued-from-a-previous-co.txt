● Looking at the aggregate process file, I can see the exact location of the KeyError. On line 48, the
   code is trying to access columns[e["field"]] where e["field"] contains the field name, but the
  columns map uses colid as keys, not field names.

  Let me check how the columns are structured by examining how they're built in the form.ex file:

● Read(vendor/selecto_components/lib/selecto_components/views/aggregate/process.ex)
  ⎿  Read 30 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● I found the issue! The problem is that line 48 in the aggregate process file is trying to access
  columns[e["field"]], but the columns map is keyed by colid, not by field names. However, e["field"]
  contains the field name (like "first_name"), not the colid.

  Let me check how the column mapping should work by looking at form.ex where the columns are
  processed:

● Read(vendor/selecto_components/lib/selecto_components/form.ex)
  ⎿  Read 15 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● The issue is that the columns map is keyed by colid (from Selecto.columns() which returns {colid => 
  column_struct} pairs), but the aggregate process is trying to look up using e["field"] which
  contains the field name.

  I need to create a reverse mapping in form.ex that allows lookup by field name. Let me fix this:

● Update(vendor/selecto_components/lib/selecto_components/form.ex)
  ⎿  Updated vendor/selecto_components/lib/selecto_components/form.ex with 8 additions          
       442            columns = Selecto.columns(selecto)
       443            
       444            # Fix column format compatibility - add :field property based on :name
       445 +          # Also create a reverse mapping by field name for aggregate process lookup
       446            columns = 
       447              columns
       448              |> Enum.into(%{}, fn {key, col} ->
       449                col_with_field = Map.put(col, :field, col.name)
       450                {key, col_with_field}
       451              end)
       452 +          
       453 +          # Create reverse mapping by field name for aggregate process
       454 +          columns = 
       455 +            columns
       456 +            |> Enum.reduce(columns, fn {colid, col}, acc ->
       457 +              Map.put(acc, col.name, col)
       458 +            end)
       459    
       460            filters_by_section =
       461              Map.values(Map.get(params, "filters", %{}))

● Now let's test this fix by running the application and trying to submit a view:

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Investigate why executed remains false after view submission                    
     ☒ Check the view_from_params execution flow to find why query isn't executing
     ☒ Fix the KeyError :field issue - need to map :name to :field in column structures
     ☐ Add reverse mapping by field name in columns to fix aggregate process lookup

● Good, the server started successfully. Let me test the fix by accessing the site and attempting to
  submit a view. But first, let me kill the server and try to run it in the background so I can access
   it:

● Good! The server is running. Now let me test the fix by trying to fetch the homepage to see if it
  works:

● Fetch(http://localhost:4085/)
  ⎿  Error: Invalid URL

● Let me check the server output and try a different approach to test the fix:

● BashOutput(Reading shell output)
  ⎿  Done in 1055ms.

● Let me try a simpler test - just run a basic test to see if the error is fixed:

● Bash(timeout 30 mix test test/selecto_basic_integration_test.exs --max-cases 1)

● I can see the issue is still occurring. The error shows that the :field property is still missing
  from the column structures. Let me examine where the KeyError is happening. From the stack trace, it
   looks like it's happening in Selecto.Builder.Sql.Select.prep_selector/2, not in the aggregate
  process where I was looking.

  Let me check that SQL builder file:

● Read(vendor/selecto/lib/selecto/builder/sql/select.ex)
  ⎿  Read 15 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Found it! The error is on line 191 where the code is trying to access conf.field, but the column
  structure from Selecto.field() uses name instead of field. This is in the SQL builder, not in the
  aggregate component.

  Let me look at more context around this:
