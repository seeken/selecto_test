Copied with love from Petal Components library

Projects using listable_components_tailwind should include Tailwind and Alpine.js as is done in this project

## Get up and running

Optionally change your database name in `dev.exs`.

1. Setup the project with `mix setup`
2. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`
3. Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
